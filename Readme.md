This repository contain three C++ programs, 'Project_Shell.cpp', 'Project_Q2.cpp', 'Project_Multithreading.cpp' along with a Makefile to help you build and run it.



## Building

To build the programs, open your Linux terminal and navigate to the directory containing these files. Then, run the following commands:

### Debug Build


make debugQ1
make debugQ2
make debugQ3

#### Optimized Build

make optimizedQ1
make optimizedQ2
make optimizedQ3

### To Build Both
make

## Running
Once you have successfully built the program, you can run it using the following commands:

# Debug Version
./debug_program_Q1.exe


# Optimized Version
 ./optimize_program1.exe

## Cleaning
You can remove the generated executable files by running:
